      <h1>My journey into ML</h1>
      <p>My first real encounter with Machine Learning happened during my time at Politecnico di Milano, in a course called <em>Model Identification and Data Analysis</em>. I didn’t know it back then, but that class would open a door I’d keep walking through ever since.</p>
      <p>The topic immediately fascinated me, and Prof. Formentin shared a few great resources that helped me dive deeper. I started exploring the theory through Yaser Abu-Mostafa’s <a href="https://work.caltech.edu/lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning from Data</a> course from Caltech — a fantastic introduction that helped me understand what was really going on behind all those mysterious algorithms.</p>
      <p>After that, I wanted to get my hands dirty. I took the <em>Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp</em> on Udemy, which gave me plenty of practical examples to experiment with.</p>
      <p>At first, I played around with small projects — things like portfolio optimization or time-series prediction for stock markets. I was convinced that with a simple neural network I could predict stock prices and become rich. Spoiler alert: that’s not how it works in the real world. But that failure taught me one of my first important lessons in ML — the difference between theory, data, and reality.</p>
      <p>For a few years, I put ML aside. My focus shifted toward classical control theory, especially MPC, and first-principle modeling — areas where I felt I could better understand and design systems from the ground up.</p>
      <p>But then something happened. The rise of LLMs completely reignited my curiosity. It felt like the whole world of AI had suddenly accelerated, and I couldn’t resist jumping back in.</p>
      <p>I started small again, this time experimenting with RL to get back into the flow. Soon after, I got my first taste of VLMs during a small challenge. In that project, I combined SAM and CLIP to build an open-vocabulary visual grounding system — an experience that showed me how far the field had evolved since my first neural network days.</p>
      <p>I was back on track and ready to dig deeper and understand the state of the art of AI at this time.</p>
